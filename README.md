Python 
We had two projects. PyPoll and PyBank.

PyBank Instructions:

In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)


Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:


The total number of months included in the dataset


The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes


The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

PyPoll Instructions:
In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.


You will be give a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:


The total number of votes cast


A complete list of candidates who received votes


The percentage of votes each candidate won


The total number of votes each candidate won


The winner of the election based on popular vote.

I relied heavely on excercises from the third class in Python, especially excercise 8. I did get assistance from the TA and worked with a tutor to get started and export the text but mostly coded off our notes and what we learned in class. I exercised my skill in storing contents as variables, lists and dictionaries, iterated through basic data structures, and write scripts for each data set.
